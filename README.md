<summary>What is Europians on UK rails? 🇪🇺->🇬🇧🚆</summary>

🇪🇺 -> 🇬🇧
With a modern world that allows you to wake up in one country and be in another by lunchtime, it is important that you understand some of the differences between how different countries operate. An example of this is the Euro Tunnel that connects Britain & France, enabling people from all over Europe to travel to the UK effortlessly. 

🧮🇬🇧
Europeans on UK Rails (EoUKR) aims to both educate and assist individuals who are not from the UK on what units of measurement are used in the UK, the web app has a user journey that teaches you about Imperial & Metric measurements and how the UK has chosen to combine the two to have their own unit of measurement. 

➖➕➗✖️
EoUKR consists of a HTML web app base that hosts a user story and a Java Script converter at the end of the story that helps the user to convert between Miles Per Hour (MPH) <-> Kilometers Per Hour (KM/H) & Litres <-> Gallons. 

👉🏻📱
You can easily navigate through the app using the built-in buttons at the bottom of each page. There is also a back arrow as you progress with the user journey, so you can return to the previous page effortlessly. I also added a button on the home page that enables you to skip straight to the converter if you want!
